# Experimentation Engine & A/B Test Analyzer

This project models a real experimentation workflow focusing on:
• Control vs Treatment comparison
• Metric computation (Conversion, Retention, Revenue per User)
• Statistical significance testing & p-value calculation
• Effect size estimation
• Automated decision-making logic
• Experiment summary generation via AI

### Components:
1. Synthetic experiment dataset
2. SQL pipeline to compute experiment metrics
3. Python script for significance testing
4. Dashboard page for experiment results
5. AI module that generates experiment reports

### Goal:
Showcase advanced product analytics, experimentation thinking, SQL capability, and AI-driven insight automation.
